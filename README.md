# LSPIS
The Lunar Supply Pod Impact Simulation (LSPIS) is a computer model meant to simulate collisions from supply pods onto the lunar (or Martian) surface without the use of fuel and minimal pre-existing structures. We hope to discover if this method of delivery is a practical possibility to deliver supplies to human residents on the moon. It calculates different initial conditions to demonstrate the survivability of the pod (and its contents) when dropped onto the lunar surface. It analyzes in-air trajectories, changes in velocity, changing environment, changes in spin, deformation, elasticity, and both elastic and inelastic collisions.
